CRYPTOTAB(5)
============
:man source:   cryptsetup
:man manual:   Cryptsetup Manual

NAME
----
cryptotab - static information about crypted filesystems (deprecated)


SYNOPSIS
--------
*cryptotab*::
'LOOPDEVICE' 'DEVICE' 'MOUNTPOINT' 'FILESYSTEM' 'ALGORITHM'[ 'MOUNTOPTIONS'[ 'INFO']]

    
DESCRIPTION
-----------

[NOTE]
===========
*/etc/cryptotab* was designed for use with the now
deprecated cryptoloop technology and must therefore be considered
deprecated as well. */etc/crypttab* (note the missing ``o'') should be
used instead.
===========

The file */etc/cryptotab* contains descriptive informations about
encrypted volumes. Each volume is described on a separate line;
columns on each line are separated by tabs or spaces. Lines starting
with "'#'" are comments, empty lines are ignored. The order of
records in *cryptotab* is important because the
*/etc/init.d/boot.crypto* script sequentially iterates through
*cryptotab* entries.

'LOOPDEVICE':: specifies the loop device to use for this mapping,
  for example `/dev/loop0`

'DEVICE':: specifies the block special device that holds the
  encrypted data

'MOUNTPOINT':: specifies the where the volume should be mounted

'FILESYSTEM':: specifies the file system of the volume

'ALGORITHM':: specifies the encryption algorithm to use
+
Supported algorithms are 'twofish', 'twofishSL92' and 'twofish256'

'MOUNTOPTIONS':: optionally specifies mount option

'INFO':: optionally specifies a string that should be printed when
  prompting for the passphrase

EXAMPLES
--------

.........
/dev/loop0 /dev/sda6 /secret ext2 twofish256
.........

SEE ALSO
--------
